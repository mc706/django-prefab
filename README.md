#django prefabricate

Tired of setting up projects and want to get to the nitty gritty of your work?

Django Prefabricate is a configration based django project prefabricator. Give it a configuration file and build out 
the vast majority of your project and environment options with a single command. 

##How does it work?
It looks at the development process of a django application as data. Breaking down the setup and initial development of 
a project as data, allows us to create the a configuration driven script to quickly automate it.

##Benefits
Your first project will probably be a break even project. However your second project will allow you to just tweak some
data in the configuration file you made for your first project, to get a project off the ground very quickly. 

##Third Party Hooks
Prefab uses some common third party development tools
* git
* git flow
* github
* hg
* bitbucket
* coverage
* vagrant
* fabric
* pip
* virtualenv
